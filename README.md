This is a basic website that was built with:
- `HTML/CSS` : to display graphic interface.
- `Javascript` : to handle logic interface.
- And uses `PHP` to push the product up the interface.

*However, I wanted it to show up more beautiful on the GitHub webpage. So, I have edited a few places to fit.*

Thanks for watching it!
